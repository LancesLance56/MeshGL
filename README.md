# Mesh Algorithms for OpenGL

This is just a small project for me as a beginner learning OpenGL!

This project aims to contain template code for generating certain shapes and Noise Meshes for OpenGL. Anyone can yoink the code; credit is not required but very much appreciated.

## Current Features (FOR GL_TRIANGLES)

* Perlin Noise Mesh
* Cube Vertices and Indices

## In Progress...
* Icosphere genrator
