# Mesh Algorithms for OpenGL

This is just a small project for me as a beginner learning OpenGL!

This project aims to contain template code for generating certain shapes and Noise Meshes for OpenGL. Anyone can yoink the code; credit is not required but very much appreciated.
By default the main.cpp file creates a small demo for the Perlin Mesh feature.

## Current Features (FOR GL_TRIANGLES)

* Perlin Noise Mesh
* Cube Vertices and Indices

## In Progress...
* Icosphere genrator

## Compilation
* CMakeLists.txt is available, you may also compile using the .idea for CLion.
* Unix Makefile
